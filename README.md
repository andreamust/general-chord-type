# General Chord Type (GCT)
This repository contains a Python re-implementation of the General Chord Type (GCT), as 
proposed by Konstantinos and Cambouropoulos in:

```
Konstantinos Giannos and Emilios Cambouropoulos. 2021. 
Symbolic Encoding of Simultaneities: Re-designing the General Chord Type Representation. 
In 8th International Conference on Digital Libraries for Musicology (DLfM '21). 
Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 67â€“74. 
https://doi.org/10.1145/3469013.3469022
```

This re-implementation refers to the refined GCT model proposed by the paper aforementioned, 
which is an improvement of the [original GCT algorithm](http://www.icmc14-smc14.net/images/proceedings/OS6-B07-AnIdiom.pdf).

The code in this repository is in no way connected to the authors of the paper, nor is it validated by them, but 
is to be intended as an interpretation based on the pseudocode and description provided in the bibliographical 
references provided.

### Novelty
In addition to the approach proposed by the paper cited above, in this repository you can find code that allows you to 
convert annotated chords in [Harte](https://ismir2005.ismir.net/proceedings/1080.pdf) format directly into the format 
proposed by the paper.
